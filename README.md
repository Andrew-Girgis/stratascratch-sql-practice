## About

This repo is a place to store and share my learnings as I work through problems on StratasScratch. Each problem gets its own folder containing a description of the challenge and one or more solution approaches.

## Structure

```text
<problem_id>_<problem_name>/
├── description.md    # Problem statement and schema info
├── solution.sql      # Initial solution
└── solution_v2.sql   # Refined or alternative approach (where applicable)
```
